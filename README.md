### Homework #6

_Due Mon. Aug.24_

####Synopsis

- **Problem 1:** Constructor Basics _[10% of total time]_ **Goals:** Practice the fundamentals of constructors and prototypes.
- **Problem 2:** Imaginary Menagerie _[15%]_ **Goals:** Practice simple inheritance and subclassing.

 **1)  Constructor basics** _[15%]_

**a)** Here's a sequence of simple exercises related to how constructors and prototypes work.

-   First make a constructor named _Ctor_ for an object that has properties _a_ and _b_ and initializes them to 0 and 1 respectively.
-   Now, make two objects named _obj1_ and _obj2_ using _Ctor_.
-   Now make a new object _obj3_ this way:
    ```
    var obj3 = {};
    Ctor.call(obj3);
    ```

    and check its properties.
-   Next, add a property _c_ to _obj1_ with a value of 2.  What will be the value of _obj2.c_?
-   Now, add a property _d_ with the value 3 to _obj1_'s "proto" (the object which helps out when _obj1_ can't do something by itself).  Remember that there are at least four ways of referring to that proto object.
[??] What are the four ways of referring to the prototype: 
obj.__proto__
obj.prototype
-   What are the values of _obj1.d_, _obj2.d_, and _obj3.d_? Can you explain the results?
[!!review??]Obj 1 and 2 inherit d=3 from the prototype because of the word 'new' which creates a new instance of Ctor, while obj3 'calls' Ctor, which is a pointer to the function and not creating a new instance. Basically, obj 3 runs the function but doesn't duplicate it, therefor doesn't inherit from Ctor's modified prototype because the modification obj1.__proto__.d = 3 occurs after Ctor. 


**b)** Consider this code:

```
function A() {};
//set default values for instances of A:
A.prototype = {num:0, str:'default'};
var objA = new A();

function B() {};
// set default values for instances of B:
B.prototype.num = 0;
B.prototype.str = 'default';
var objB = new B();
```

There is a difference between the behaviors of `objA` and `objB`!  Explain.

**2) Imaginary Menagerie** _[35%]_

**a)** Implement a simple taxonomy of four related classes, using a constructor for each:

- _Animal_: every instance of an Animal should inherit a method called _move()_.  For basic animals, this just returns the string "walk".
- _Bird_: A subclass of Animal.  Every Bird instance should return "fly" instead of "walk" when asked to _move()_.  All Birds also have a property _hasWings_ which is true.
- _Fish_: Another subclass of Animal.  A Fish instance will "swim" instead of "walk".
- _Penguin_: A subclass of Bird.  Penguins cannot fly and they should move like Fish.

Every instance of Animal and its subclasses should also have a personal _name_ property which is not inherited.  It should be set only within the constructor Animal, and each subclass should each ensure that its own constructor calls its superclass constructor as an initializer.

You should see these behaviors:
```
new Animal("Simba").move();// 'walk'
new Fish("Nemo").move();// 'swim'
new Bird("Lulu").move();// 'fly'
var pengo = new Penguin("Pengo");
pengo.name;     // "Pengo"
pengo.move();   //'swim'
pengo.hasWings; //true;
pengo instanceof Penguin; //true
pengo instanceof Bird; 	  //true
pengo instanceof Animal;  //true
```

**b)** Create a class _Egg_, whose instances have one method, _hatch(name)_, which returns a new instance (named _name_) of the same species which laid the egg.
Assume that every Animal can lay an egg with an instance method _layEgg()_ which creates a new Egg instance.
Try to solve this without subclassing Egg and without implementing _layEgg_ and _hatch_ more than once.

You should see this behavior:
```
var pengo = new Penguin("Pengo");
var egg = pengo.layEgg();
egg.constructor === Egg; //true
var baby = egg.hatch("Penglet");
baby instanceof Penguin; //true

var nemo = new Fish("Nemo");
egg = nemo.layEgg();
egg.constructor === Egg; //true
baby = egg.hatch("Nemolet");
baby instanceof Fish; //true

```

**3) Specialty Cards** _[50%]_

There's good news and bad news.  The good news: the card factory from last week has been completely reimplemented as a constructor with a prototype, and it already works perfectly!  The code is [here](solution3-cards.js), and you can load it into your browser with [this HTML file](cards.html).

The bad news is that your friends have learned of your Javascript card-writing skills and requested two different speciality card sets.  Fortunately, you know that by using inheritance, you can extend and modify your working Card class without rewriting much code.

For each of the exercises below, you should write an IIFE in a separate file which defines a constructor function implementing a subclass of Card.  _Do not modify the [existing file](solution3-cards.js) or the Card code within it._  Instead write a pair of new constructors which inherit as much as possible from Card.

(_Note: the earlier property `fullSet` has been removed from `Card`, and you may omit it from your subclasses as well.  If you need a full set, write your own loop.)_

**a)**  In [this template](template3a-tarot.js), finish writing the constructor `TarotCard`.  Tarot cards (Minor only!) are similar to ordinary playing cards, but with four differences:

1. Their suit names are "Cups", "Pentacles", "Swords", and "Wands".
2. A Jack is called instead a "Knight", and there is one extra rank "Page" between "Ten" and "Knight".  Therefore there are 56 total cards.
3. Tarot cards have no color, and should have no such method.  You'll need to block any `color` method which would be inherited from Cards.
4. Each tarot card instance can be oriented normally or upside-down, and each has a boolean property reflecting that orientation.

The classes `Card` and `TarotCard` should be able to co-exist and pass all of the tests in [this file](card-tests.js).  You can make a regular card with `var card0 = new Card(0)` and a Tarot card with `var tarot0 = new TarotCard(0)`.


**b)** In [this template](template3b-images.js), write a constructor `ImageCard`.  An ImageCard is just an ordinary Card which can draw itself in the browser.  In addition to the methods inherited from Card, each ImageCard instance should have another method `render(container)`.  The parameter `container` is a should be either a DOM element (a \<div\> for example), or a string with the id of a DOM element.  The `render` method should add to the DOM, within that container, an image element corresponding to the card.  For testing, you may use `document.body` as a container, as in
`card0.render(document.body)`.

A set of card images can be found in the (images)[./images] directory.  You'll need each ImageCard to generate the correct filename for its own rank and suit.  For example, the card instance made by `new ImageCard(0)` should use the image file named "ace_of_hearts.svg". 

_Note: we haven't taught you how to do DOM manipulation yet!_  Some of you may already know enough to figure this out; the rest of you will by the end of next week.  Get as far as you can.  As a start, study this example from the template:

```
var myHtml = '<img class="cardImage" src="../images/SVG-cards-1.3/red_joker.svg">';
document.body.innerHTML += myHtml;
```
